Exceptions

 1. Naming
   Class Variables  -->  CapWord.  This is easier to identify as a class variable as it follows the same convention
                                   as for a class name.

   Functions --> camelCase.  I hate functions with "_" as a separator eg get_caller_func.  Should be getCallerFunc like
                             99% of all language convention.
